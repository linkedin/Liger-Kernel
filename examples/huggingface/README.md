# Liger-Kernel Example with HuggingFace Trainer

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh run_{MODEL}.sh
```

**Notes**
1. This example uses an optional `use_liger` flag. If true, it does a 1 line monkey patch to apply liger kernel.
2. The example uses Llama3 model that requires community license agreement and HuggingFace Hub login. If you want to use Llama3 in this example, please make sure you have done the followings:
    * Agree on the community license agreement https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B
    * Run `huggingface-cli login` and enter your HuggingFace token
3. The default hyperparameters and configurations work on single node with 4xA100 80GB GPUs. For running on device with less GPU RAM, please consider reducing the per-GPU batch size and/or enable `CPUOffload` in FSDP.


## Benchmark Result

### LLaMA
Benchmark conditions: LLaMA 3-8B, Alpaca Dataset, Max seq len = 512, Data Type = bf16, Optimizer = AdamW, Gradient Checkpointing = True, Distributed Strategy = FSDP1 on 4 A100s.

Throughput improves by around 20%, while GPU memory usage drops by 40%. This allows you to train the model on smaller GPUs, use larger batch sizes, or handle longer sequence lengths without incurring additional costs.

### QWEN
Benchmark conditions: Qwen2-7B, Alpaca Dataset, Max seq len = 512, Data Type = bf16, Optimizer = AdamW, Gradient Checkpointing = True, Distributed Strategy = FSDP1 on 4 A100s.

Throughput improves by around 10%, while GPU memory usage drops by 50%.
