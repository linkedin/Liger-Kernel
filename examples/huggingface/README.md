## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh run.sh

**Notes**
1. The example uses Llama3 model that requires community license agreement and HuggingFace Hub login. If you want to use Llama3 in this example, please make sure you have done the followings:
    * Agree on the community license agreement https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B
    * Run `huggingface-cli login` and enter your HuggingFace token
2. The default hyperparameters and configurations work on single node with 4xA100 GPUs. For running on device with less GPU RAM, please consider reducing the per-GPU batch size and/or enable `CPUOffload` in FSDP.
